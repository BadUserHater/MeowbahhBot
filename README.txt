===============SECTION 1.2 - WHATS NEW=======================

This section shows what is new for the source code.

HERE IS THE NEW FIRST RELEASE OF THE BOT USING DISCORD.PY 2.0 (this is officially the second commit)
Rewritten because discord.py 1.7.x may stop working. Also did
- Add more responses to the askmeow command
- A couple more memes
- More images in the resources zip file.

===============SECTION 1.3 - Bad Users=======================

This source code for a bot is intended to make the bot (a.k.a. make a Bad user) trash. Here are some example of bad users

- Lisa Gaming Roblox - Supports CP and deletes people's houses on Bloxburg
- Meowbahh - Racist and wants people to k*ll themselves
- Bella the Wolf - Abused the Military
- BudsForBuddies - Abuses animals.
- Anna - Lets Get Acquainted - A spambot
- That Vegan Teacher - Forces people to become vegan in very dumb ways

You can take your anger out of these users by making a bot based on them.
